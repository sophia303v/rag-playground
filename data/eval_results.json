Bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest radiographs are often associated with pulmonary infections, such as pneumonia, or interstitial lung diseases like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [Source 3: Report CXR_0010 (findings)].\n\nConsidering the patient's history of IV drug use, one should consider infectious causes such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) or nocardiosis. PCP is more common in immunocompromised patients and can present with bilateral ground-glass opacities [Source 2: Report CXR_0010 (full)].\n\nOther potential differential diagnoses include:\n\n* Pulmonary tuberculosis\n* Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis\n* Miliary tuberculosis\n\nIt's essential to note that the reports provided do not contain any information about the patient's current condition or symptoms.
